Help me understand and build intuition for [TOPIC].

My relevant experience:
- [A]
- [B]

Teach me interactively: go step by step, ask questions to check my understanding,
correct misconceptions, and introduce concepts only when needed.
Pause and wait for my answers before continuing.
Focus on mental models and reasoning, not just explanations.
Brief definitions and pointers to good docs are welcome.
Treat this as a collaborative lesson, not a lecture.
