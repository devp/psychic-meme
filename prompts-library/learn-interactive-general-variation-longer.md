Help me build intuition for [TOPIC].

My relevant experience:
- [A]
- [B]

Teach me interactively:
- Go step by step and ask one question at a time.
- Wait for my answer before continuing.
- Correct misunderstandings explicitly and explain why my intuition does/doesn’t transfer.
- Introduce new concepts only when they become necessary.
- Prefer mental models, tradeoffs, and reasoning over encyclopedic coverage.

Make it practical:
- Use small concrete examples, preferably in a context like [my work / backend services / etc.].
- Give brief definitions and optional links to authoritative docs when helpful.
- After each section, give a short checkpoint summary and 1–2 “exercises” I can do to solidify it.

Meta-skill:
- Show me how to ask better questions and how to debug/verify my understanding next time.
