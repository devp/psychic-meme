Useful prompts I'd like to share.

- [learn-interactive-general.md](https://github.com/devp/psychic-meme/blob/main/prompts-library/learn-interactive-general.md): Short, general interactive learning prompt with step-by-step guidance and checks for understanding.
- [learn-interactive-general-variation-longer.md](https://github.com/devp/psychic-meme/blob/main/prompts-library/learn-interactive-general-variation-longer.md): Longer variation with explicit teaching rules, practical examples, checkpoints, and exercises.
