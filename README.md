# psychic-meme

Placeholder for the `psychic-meme` project, which does not yet exist.

## FAQ

*1. What is the psychic-meme project?*

It does not yet exist.

*2. What is here instead?*

Currently, miscellaneous side-projects that I'd like visible in a public repository. Maybe that's what `psychic-meme` was always about.

- [lightsabers](lightsabers)
- [mermaid-utils](mermaid-utils)

*4. What if I have a better idea?*

Let me know at `dev.purkayastha@gmail.com`.

*5. Why `psychic-meme`?*

In December 2022, GitHub randomly suggested this repo name. It was such a good name that I had to take it, and I assumed I would find a use for it.
