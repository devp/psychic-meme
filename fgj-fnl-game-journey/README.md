# Fennel Game Journeys 

## Goal

Use Fennel programming language to create a personal DSL of game-like objects and experiments, both "video games" and adjacent to analog game design.

## Motivation

By deeply learning a lisp dialect, I hope to experience the promised "lisp epiphany" that can affect my programming work elsewhere.

Key concepts:

* functional programming
* macros
* homoiconicity

## Process

A working journal will be kept in [blog.md](blog.md).
