# Fennel Game Journeys 

## Goal

Use Fennel programming language to create a personal DSL of game-like objects and experiments, both "video games" and adjacent to analog game design.

## Motivation

By deeply learning a lisp dialect, I hope to experience the promised "lisp epiphany" that can affect my programming work elsewhere.

Key concepts:

* functional programming
* macros
* homoiconicity

## Ideas

- neovim IDE config in fennel (incremental alongside lua)
- developer setup for productive iterations with TIC-80 and fennel
- develop my first trivial TIC-80 cart
